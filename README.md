Openframeworks Native American Masks Experiment

# Project Concept
Initial Idea and Project Goal
The tribal cultural tradition about body and face painting has always been very intriguing to me. At the beginning of the project, my idea was to create a mixed reality experience to give life this very old tradition today. After I started the project I had the chance to visit Brooklyn Museum and, I came across with brilliant Native American Masks at the exhibition names as “Life, Death, and Transformation in the Americas” and decided to create and installation about them. 
The main goal of the project is to create an immersive experience by using sound and personal gestures to navigate between 4 different masks including Celebration, War, Death and Daily life ceremonies. While doing this, I wanted the user to be able to get some feedback about some data belong to this terms but so far I couldn’t implement the data
